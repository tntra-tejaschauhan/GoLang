Observer:- it defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that:
    when one object (subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified automatically.

    simple meaning:
        one publisher 
        many subscriber
        when publisher updates -> all subscriber get notified


    Example:
    
    - You build an Order Service

    When order is created:

        Send Email
        Send SMS
        Update Analytics
        Trigger Inventory deduction

    Instead of hardcoding:
        sendEmail()
        sendSMS()
        updateAnalytics()

    We use Observer.
