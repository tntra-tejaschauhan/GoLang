What is Abstract Factory?

it creates families of relataed objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factory method - creates one object
Abstract factory  - create multiple related objects

Use case

    we will build a notification system that supports:
        Email Sender
        Sms Sender
    But we want to support multiple provider:
        Aws provider
        Gcp provider
    Each provider gives its own:
        Email implementation
        Sms implementation

So:

Provider        Email       SMS
----------------------------------
AWS          AWS Email   	AWS SMS
GCP	         GCP Email	    GCP SMS

these are family of realated objects.

We did NOT use:

extends
abstract class
inheritance

Go achieves Abstract Factory purely using:

interfaces
package separation
composition

That is idiomatic Go.
