### type is use to create custom types (Domain Modeling)

In Java:

Everything revolves around class

In Go:

Everything revolves around type

Struct → type
Interface → type
Enum-like → type
Function → type
Custom primitive → type

It’s the foundational building block of Go.


- Without type, your code becomes this:

    func Transfer(from string, to string, amount int64)


- With type, your code becomes this:

    func Transfer(from AccountID, to AccountID, amount Money)
